# SHELL #

## Introduction ##

The goal of this project was to understand the mechanics of a shell by implementing one. The created shell takes commands from the user, sends them to an operating system then executes them. 

## Implementation ##

Implementation of this project consisted of 5 steps:

1.  Executing simple commands on shell using fork(), exec() and wait().
2.  Installing the built in commands to the shell.
3.  Implementing redirection.
4.  Implementing piping.
5.  Error management.
6.  Implementing extra features.
